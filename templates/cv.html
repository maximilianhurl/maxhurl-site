            <p>I have been tasked with leading a small multidisciplinary team building the forecasting application, a key selling point of the Futrli platform. This involves advising the PM on technical aspects of the project and ensuring our backlog fits in with the complex dependancies between concurrently developed products. I also manage the developers on the team on a personnel level trying to promote an honest, supporting and enjoyable dynamic. Plus, of course, developing the front and backend of the product.</p>

            <p>During my time at Airfinity my<br/>experience allowed me to get up to speed quickly and contribute to all levels of the tech stack. From the data ingestion backend through to the data warehouse, internal Django powered API layer and finally to the frontend web application.<br/><br/></p>
            <p>I also built the libraries needed to allow the team to gradually move to a React driven SPA while helping my colleagues get to grips with some of the trickier parts of the frameworks.</p>

            <p>My role at DabApps changed<br/>considerably from when I first joined. As the company grew in team and project size my work needed to adapt with it. This allowed me to get involved with projects at every step of the process from initial discussions with clients through to architecture planning, maintaining automated deployment scripts and large scale refactoring multiple years later.<br/><br/></p>

            <p><br/>As part of my role I mentored multiple junior developers and coordinated technical tasks of developers on a number of projects. I was also tasked with personnel management including appraisals and helping maintain developer satisfaction.</p>

            <p>My tasks included designing and developing a new company website and CMS, creating hi-res video/animation content, building PC based media servers, designing an iOS app, helping with phone support and producing promotional material. Due to the size and nature of the company’s work no one else had much experience with design, animation or web development. This meant I usually had to resolve my own issues and do a lot of self-directed learning.</p>
