            <p>The role included designing and developing a new company website and CMS, creating hi-res video/animation content, building PC based media servers, designing an iOS app, helping with phone support and producing promotional material. Due to the size and nature of the company’s work no one else had much experience with design, animation or web development. This meant I usually had to resolve my own issues and do a lot of self-directed learning.</p>
